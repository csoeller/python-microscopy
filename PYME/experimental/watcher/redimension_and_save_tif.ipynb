    "# Recapitulate compressed, spooled data into a series of tiles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used together with PYME.experimental.watcher to spool and compress files coming from 3rd party acquisition software into PYMEs compressed format. This notebook handles reading the compressed data and re-exporting as a series of tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- python\n",
    "- python-microscopy\n",
    "- pyme-compress\n",
    "\n",
    "Easiest way to get this (at present with broken conda packages) is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting from a miniforge install with mamba and with conda-forge in the channels list, create a new environment:\n",
    "`mamba create -c david_baddeley -n PYME python=3.X pyme-depends`  where x in is between 8 and 11 inclusive\n",
    "- make sure you have the MS Visual C version matiching your python version (should be a free download, if you don't know which version, you can always wait until you get an error from python setup.py develop).\n",
    "- activate the environment: `conda activate PYME`\n",
    "- change to a suitable directory and checkout the latest PYME from the github repository:\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/python-microscopy/python-microscopy.git`\n",
    "- `cd python-microscopy`\n",
    "- `python setup.py develop`\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally test by trying to run the viewer `PYMEImage --test3D` (this could fail on wxpython issues even if you have an install which will work as a library)\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAM drive\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a RAM drive to spool to (optional in first instance, but desirable for speed eventually)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PYMEDataDir\n",
    "\n",
    "If the compressed data should be saved somewhere other than your home directory, the PYMEDataDir config option needs to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open (or if necescesary create) `config.yaml` in `{home}/.PYME`\n",
    "- add a line `dataserver-root: \"/path/to/directory/for/compressed.data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conda activate PYME`\n",
    "- `PYMEClusterOfOne` (this launches the server which will recieve and save compressed frames - this could also be a full multicomputer PYME cluster, but ClusterOfOne is a good place to start)\n",
    "- Start spooling in your acquisition software (.tif to a directory of your choosing, ideally on ram disk)\n",
    "- `python -m PYME.experimental.watcher /path/to/acquisition/tif/directory PYMECLUSTER:///path/to/somefile.pcs`  ie `python -m PYME.experimental.watcher input_directory output_series`\n",
    "- Wait for acquisition to finish\n",
    "- hit `Ctrl-C` in the terminal running `PYME.experimental.watcher`\n",
    "\n",
    "**FIXME: The watcher currently uses hard-coded values for camera ADOffset and electrons per count. I think these are suitable for the PYME simulator, NOT for your camera. This needs to be altered and/or exposed as config items** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconstruction (this notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This should be run in your `PYME` environment created earlier.\n",
    "- The data server (PYMEClusterOfOne) must be running"
